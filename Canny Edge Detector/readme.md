How to run using source file:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed(python, matplotlib and numpy)
2. Use command: python CED.py <image_file_name>
A) make sure image is grayscale image with only 1 channel; otherwise program will throw
error.
B) This is given on matplotlib site: “Matplotlib can only read PNGs natively. Further image
formats are supported via the optional dependency on Pillow. Note, URL strings are not
compatible with Pillow”
3. Make sure, while running the program you have appropriate rights to write and read image
at that location; because program writes output image.
